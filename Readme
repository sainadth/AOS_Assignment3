## Implementation of comparision between FIFO and LRU in C++
Comparison between LRU and FIFO, ofcourse LRU is the efficient

## Used unordered_set and queue to Implement FIFO effectively
- Just a queue following FIFO rule
- no mechanism to handle recent usage of a page

## Used unordered_map and list (double linked list) to Implement LRU effectively
- uses a double linked list foe efficient removal and unordered_map for fast lookup
- recently used pages are most likely stays in memory
